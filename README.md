# NeuralNetProject
Semester course project where Neural Nets were implemented to predict the output value of each training instance given the training data. 

Note: This project is written in Java. Be sure to have the enivorment variables set to the address of the jdk/jre bin if you are using Windows. 
      Make sure that the testing data files are in the same location as the java file and that only two arguments are written when typing the Java NeuralProject *Arg1 here* *Arg2 here* command.

To run this code 

1) Extract this zip folder ("FinalProject.zip") to the directory you wish to extract it, and open the project folder. ("FinalProject" in this case)

2) Open the NeuralProject folder and you should see the correct java file, which is "NeuralProject.java". 

3) On the command prompt/bash terminal, go to the directory where the .java file is located using: 
               cd *address of the directory* 

4) Once there, use the following command to compile the java file which you can now run in the terminal:
                  javac NeuralProject.java

5) Now there should be an executable file called "NeuralProject.class". In order to execute the program type to the terminal: 
		java NeuralProject *arg 1* *arg 2* 

Where arg 1 is the training text file and arg 2 is the test text file. 

An output text file displaying the predicted class values ("output.txt") should be produced after running the program.
